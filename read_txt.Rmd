Here is reading the txt file into r.
I use readLines().
It took several mins to read one txt file.

Note: Something went wrong during knit HTML, but rm file still OK.
There is no problem when I just run this three readLines() in different r script file.
```{r}
nLpBlogs <- readLines("final/en_US/en_US.blogs.txt")
nLpNews <- readLines("final/en_US/en_US.news.txt")
nLpTwitter <- readLines("final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt")


```
## Here are error message!
