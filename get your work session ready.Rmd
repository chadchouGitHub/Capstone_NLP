# Install require package
rJava package is require for all NLP r package in this practice, but install rJava may have some problem 
in some computers. ( When I try to install the first, my r section abort. )
Note: Installation rJava has no problem. It is running library(rJava).
I need to download JE 6 first before I run library(rJava)
Update: I repeat same installation in Win8.1 It seems no need for JE6 to install before I run the "rJava"
```{r}
 ##install.packages("rJava")
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx8000m")
library(rJava)


```
Here will install lot of package for NLP, and other packages need for these package. 
```{r}
## install.packages(c("NLP", "openNLP", "RWeka", "qdap"))
```
This is not needed for English, but I still do it. I also limit to "En".
```{r}
## install.packages("openNLPmodels.en",
##              repos = "http://datacube.wu.ac.at/",
##               type = "source")
```
Loading the library for NLP
```{r}
library(NLP)
library(openNLP)
library(RWeka)
```

### You are ready to go on NLP.
