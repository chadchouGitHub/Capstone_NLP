This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(knitr)
twitter <- system('wc -lwm final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt',intern = T)
```
 wc is system commond
 Using system() to run system commond. -lwm is for wc. it mean length, word counts, and size (m? not sure)
```{r}
news <- system('wc -lwm final/en_US/en_US.news.txt',intern = T)
blogs <- system('wc -lwm final/en_US/en_US.blogs.txt',intern = T)
ten <- as.numeric(grep('[[:digit:]]', unlist(strsplit(twitter," ")), value = T))
```
twitter = " 2360148 30373603 166816544 final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt"
split the elements of a character by " " in twitter and unlist it.
Use grep to find digits ( number in txt) and change to numbers
```{r}
nen <- as.numeric(grep('[[:digit:]]', unlist(strsplit(news," ")), value = T))
ben <- as.numeric(grep('[[:digit:]]', unlist(strsplit(blogs," ")), value = T))
en <- as.data.frame(rbind(ten,nen,ben))
rownames(en) <- c("twitter","news","blogs")
colnames(en) <- c("line_counts","word_counts","document_size")
kable(en, align='c', caption = "Summary of the datasets")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```
